#+TITLE: Installation GuixSD

I only installed it on a virtual machine for curiosity.  One problem I
encountered is not able to log into normal user in Gnome.  It turns out I need
to first set the password for normal user under ~root~ account.


* Hardware support
Although the documentation says that GuixSD supports most of the existing
hardware, but that's not true and I think it's an elephant in the room. :( Most
of the modern GPUs are not supported in Guix with their restricted kernel.

Build store environment has very restricted view of hardwares.  /dev/ directory
is basically empty there and I don't know how to use udev rules to add more
devices into store like what nix does. :(
