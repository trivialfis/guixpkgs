This repository hosts some guix package definitions that yet to be upstreamed
or simply can not be upstreamed.

If any of the package is merged into upstream, it should gain an entry in
`upstreamed.org` and will be removed from the source tree.  Sometimes it's more
convenient for me to keep a few of them here. :)

I want to maintain this repository, but with my very limited resource, this
doesn't seem possible.  If you want to help, please make an issue or PR. :)

* Channel
You can use the following snippet for making this repository as additional channel, be aware that I'm not
constantly following up with the upstream.  Feel free to open an issue if you found some broken packages.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

Many libraries are packaged as dependencies, just grep "define-public".
